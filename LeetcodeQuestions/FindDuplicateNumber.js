// Hint:

// #1.
// Think of model of linked list, and algorithm of cycle detection.
// A common and practical one is Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as Floyd's algorithm.

// #2.
// Convert this challenge into cycle detection in linked list, and locating of start node of cycle.

// Each array cell denotes a node in linked list.
// And the value of each array cell points to the next node in linked list.

// Finally, what we want to know is the duplicate number, which also is the start node of cycle, and vice versa.

// We take the demo input as example, please refer to the diagram as following.

// #3.

// Remeber that description asks us not to modify the array.
// (assume the array is read only).

// Illustration:

// Input:
// nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
